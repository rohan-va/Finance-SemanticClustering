# Finance Semantic Clustering
----------------------------------
This repository contains a program used for a MIT IAP class workshop - Deploying AI with Finance. I created this program to showcase the clustering capability of Mantis AI and its powerful ability to find similar/old patterns with data, mapping them to users.

This project was created in Google COLAB using the Python programming language, incorporating features such as embeddings, ingestion, mapping, and more - the core of Mantis.
